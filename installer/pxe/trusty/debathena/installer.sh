# Sigh.  check-missing-firmware is too stupid to reconfigure the NIC after
# removing and reloading the module.  So we lose network in the middle
# of the install.  The card works just fine without firmware, so we
# just convince hwdetect and friends that there is no missing firmware.
# NOTE: Although the nic-firmware udeb does not include the Realtek
# firmware, shipping the firmware ourselves does not fix the problem,
# because check-missing-firmware still insists on reloading the module
# and we lose the network configuration.

    # installation process.
